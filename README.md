## 🧐 What is this?

The **Pupusa Index** is a fun, interactive economic tool inspired by _The Economist's_ Big Mac Index. It measures the **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)** in El Salvador using the country's most beloved dish: the **Pupusa**.

By tracking the price of a standard _Revuelta_ pupusa, we can analyze:

- **Inflation**: How prices change over time.
- **Labor Value**: How many minutes of minimum wage work it takes to earn a meal.
- **Global Parity**: How much cheaper it is to live in El Salvador vs. the USA.

## ✨ Features

- **📊 Real-Time Metrics**: Live updates on average pupusa prices.
- **⏱️ Time to Feast**: Calculates the "sweat equity" required to buy a pupusa based on minimum wage.
- **🌎 Global Parity**: Compares local purchasing power against US prices.
- **🗣️ Bilingual Support**: Fully localized in **English** and **Spanish** (Español).
- **🧮 Pupusa Calculator**: Enter your budget and see how many you can eat!
- **🔐 Admin Dashboard**: Secure interface for updating prices dynamically.
